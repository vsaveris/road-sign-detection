# road_sign_detection
Road sign detection is a technology started being available in public already in 2008 (BMW 7 series) and it is continuously evolving. Currently its main use is as a component of the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and a main feature on the design of autonomous cars. In the scientific field, there are a lot of papers from researchers in which they describe and demonstrate work flows for a more accurate and faster Traffic Sign Detection. In their focus it is not only to suggest improvements in the traditional computer vision techniques but additionally to combine Machine Learning algorithms which can boost the performance of object detection in general. In this project, my aim is to study the recent papers on the topic and to produce a system which can successfully recognize Traffic Signs and Lights from real world images. My selected approach and implementation results will be presented on this report.
